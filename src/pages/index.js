        <h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>
        <h4>
          I'm a DevOps engineer as of this moment working on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/guardium-insights" className="link">IBM Guardium Insights</a>, after completing my  computer science degree in May. <br />
          Officially, my job is to bridge the gap between development code and production level code by ensuring that the development code works in a productionÂ environment. I also work with third-party products to incorporate into our product.
          <br />
          It's all about making the deadlines as stress-free as possible by finding issues in the code and bringing these issues up with the developers, so that the issues can be dealt with promptly.

          As of this moment, I'm working on a workout tracker application alongside another individuals such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/syed-razi/" className="link">Razi Syed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omer3siddiqui14/" className="link">Omer Siddiqui</a>. As all of us do workout, we thought this would be a good project in getting more experience with React and creating full stack applications. The application can be found <a href="https://github.com/Nasireen/workout-tracker" className="link">here</a>.

            Learning and constantly growing is something that is fundamental to the job as someone in the CS field. As of this moment, I am taking some courses to learn Ansible in more detail. I am also reviewing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms with the resources linked below.
