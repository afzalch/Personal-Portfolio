          I'm a DevOps engineer as of this moment, soon to become a final year computer science student in around a month. <br />
          Officially, my job is to bridge the gap between development code and production level code by ensuring that the development code works in a productionÂ environment. I also work with third-party products to incorporate into our product.
          <br />
          It's all about making the deadlines as stress-free as possible by finding issues in the code and bringing these issues up with the developers, so that the issues can be dealt with promptly.
          <br />
          If developers are to be considered as chefs, my role could be described as a head chef as I approve and polish the dishes(code) before they reach the customer.
