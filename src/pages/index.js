        <h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>
        <h4>
          I'm a DevOps engineer as of this moment working on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/guardium-insights" className="link">IBM Guardium Insights</a>, soon to become a final year computer science student in around a month. <br />
          Officially, my job is to bridge the gap between development code and production level code by ensuring that the development code works in a productionÂ environment. I also work with third-party products to incorporate into our product.
          <br />
          It's all about making the deadlines as stress-free as possible by finding issues in the code and bringing these issues up with the developers, so that the issues can be dealt with promptly.

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <h4>
          As of this moment, I'm working on a workout tracker application alongside another individuals such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/syed-razi/" className="link">Razi Syed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omer3siddiqui14/" className="link">Omer Siddiqui</a>. As all of us do workout, we thought this would be a good project in getting more experience with React and creating full stack applications. The application can be found <a href="https://github.com/Nasireen/workout-tracker" className="link">here</a>.

          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <h4>
            Learning and constantly growing is something that is fundamental to the job as someone in the CS field. As of this moment, I do not have any courses planned to take over the next month as I soon begin my final year of my undergraduate degree in September. I am reviewing both my data structure and algorithms knowledge by doing Leetcode problems as well as watching Youtube videos on said topics.
