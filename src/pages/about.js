      <h1>Who Am I</h1>
      <h3>I'm a third year student at McMaster studying Computer Science, and am currently in the middle of my 16 month internship with IBM. I'm someone who loves to volunteer and bring joy to other's people's lives. Some attributes that best describe would be unique, dramatic, and amusing. I'm unique due to my constant use of Japanese in regular day life. I make it a point to get my audience to laugh at the start of all my presentations which allows me to relax and helps ease my nerves.</h3>
      <h1>Current Work</h1>
      <h3>For the first 8 months of my internship working as mainly as backend engineer working with technologies such as protobuf and Golang to create API and some calculations. I am now parts of devops team of my product in which I work with incorporating other technologies with our own product. Recently, I was in charge of incorporating Db2 warehouse with my department's product. </h3>
      <h1>Future Goals</h1>
      <h3>My future goals at the moment would be to graduate in the immediate future, before working in the software industry for 10+ years. During this time, I want to be able to do a Masters and then eventually complete a PHD so that I may become a professor in the latter part of my career. I want to become a career since I want to be able to interact with people more as well as guiding others in their future endeavours. Teaching in my opinion is the most rewarding profession since you can see first-hand the profound impact that you can leave on someone and see how people grow.</h3>
      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <h3>I have countless programming interests such as</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Data Science</li>
        <li>Game Development</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Some other non-programming related interests are sports whether it's playing or watching sports. I am learning to juggle and Japanese these days. In addition, I have a YouTube channel about anime which is something I have been watching since I was 6 years old and resulted in me falling in love with the Japanese language and culture. I plan of going to Japan once to actually see and experience Japanese culture first-hand! </h3>
