        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <h4>
          I am a student at McMaster University who will begin my final year of my computer science degree in September. Something that is important to me is to aid other people in their endeavors. Being able to have a positive impact on other people is something that drives me and computer science is one of the best fields because of the need for your skills and the numerous ways you can assist others whether that means an organization or a person. I chose to go into computer science fields so I could have an impact on the world however small that is and whether that means making an application or website that only a few people will use or lots of people will use.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h4>
        My future goals at the moment would be to graduate in the immediate future, before working in the software industry. Another goal would be to create my own YouTube channel in which I create tutorials and tips for others in the industry and/or newcomers hoping to enter the industry. Another goal for me would be to teach or mentors others. I hope to either have the opportunity to create some courses online on sites such as Udemy and go on from there to having opportunity to mentor others in the field. In this industry, with our constant use of sites such as StackOverflow and getting advice from others such as co-workers, it seems only right to do the same to others and pay it forward.
